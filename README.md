# Million-API-Server - ASD-Hackathon

## How to start

1. Clone repository
2. cd into directory
3. npm start (node/npm must be installed on the computer)

The server runs on localhost on port 3000. Besides using the frontend (another repository), you can send requests to the server like this (mainly for testing the server):

http://localhost:3000/?numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

The first 6 numbers are your lottery numbers, the last number is the additional number. In german, the number is known as "Zusatzzahl".
