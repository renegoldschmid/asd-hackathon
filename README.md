# Million-API-Server - ASD-Hackathon

## Prerequisites

NodeJS and NPM must be installed on your machine.

## How to start

1. Clone repository
2. cd into directory
3. npm start

The server runs on localhost on port 3000. 

Besides using the frontend (https://github.com/AlexPrinz/million), you can send requests to the server using this URL (mainly for testing the server):

http://localhost:3000/?numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

The first 6 numbers are your lottery numbers, the last number is the additional number. In german, the number is known as "Zusatzzahl".
